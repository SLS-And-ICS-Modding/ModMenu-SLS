# ModMenu-SLS
Mod Menu for Streamer Life Simulator
 
# it's my first mod that i'm not using injecting dll directly into game but using Melon Loader

## the melon loader is kinda bugged in SLS so you need to install with my tutorial
1. you download MelonLoader installer from their website and install melonloader like it shows
2. after instalation you need to go to folder with SLS, you will now have folder windows_content go into it
3. and copy these folders ![image](https://github.com/Zordon1337/ModMenu-SLS/assets/65111609/6d33fabe-866f-4a2d-8576-c577f6cdfb19) into the parent folder of the windows_content
4. now paste the dll from releases into folder mods
5. it should work now
